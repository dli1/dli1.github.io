# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We build a semantic search engine on scientific articles. The major challenge is that there is no labeled data for training and testing. We apply a state-of-the-art unsupervised dense retrieval model called Generative Pseudo Labeling that generates high-quality pseudo training labels.
